This program detects anomalies in the spending habits of an account to flag that account for being possible fradulent spending

Here's how:
* The program takes a .xlsx file and reads the spending habits of the account
* Use the sklearn frame work to train and test the data 
* Use the K-neighbors to fit the model

Once it finish computing it will output the predicted and the actually results

### Built With

The program was built using the frame work listed below:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
